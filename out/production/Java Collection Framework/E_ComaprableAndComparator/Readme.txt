Comparable and Comparator

To sort custom objects like student or employee
we need to provide explicit sorting logic

To achieve this java provides the comparable and comparator interfaces

Comparable and comparator in java allow us to define custom sorting behaviour
for objects including sorting based on multiple data members.
